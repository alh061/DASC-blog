I am a current sophomore at the University of Arkansas studying Industrial Engineering with minors in Data Analytics and Supply Chain Management. I am interested in Data Analytics/Data Science because I believe that every day the world becomes more and more automated, creating large amounts of data. To be able to analyze and interpret this data will be crucial to future success. I am especially interested in how data is an important factor to the logisitics and transportation area of businesses. 

This blog is serving as the final project for a Programming Languages for Data Science class.
